What are Database Indexing <Br />
In a database, there are two primary functions: storing data and retrieving it when
needed. While storing data is generally fast, retrieval can be slower because the
database typically scans each row line by line to find the required information.
When dealing with a large number of rows, this process can become significantly time-consuming.
To address this issue, indexing was introduced, allowing databases to retrieve data
more efficiently and quickly.
<Br />
In simple terms intexing is the pointer to the data in the table. The pointer helps
the storage engine to locate the data. Any kind of index usually slow down writes,
because the index also needs to be updated every time a new data is inserted.
<Br />
There are various kind off data structure that can be used for indexing such as Hash
Indexes, SSTable and LSM-Trees etc
<Br />

Hash index are the type of indexes that store data in key value pair. Key value pair
stores are quite similar to dictonary type that you can find in any programming language
which are usually implemented as a hash map. This is similar to hash map it is the
simplest possible indexing stratergy in this whe ever you append a new key value
pair in the file you also have to update the Hash map to reflect the offset of the
data you just wrote
<Br />
<H2>Heres the Breakdown of that statement</H2>
<BulletIcon>
  The hash map (stored in memory) keeps track of where each key's value is
  located in the file.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  The offset is the position (or byte location) in the file where the new data
  starts.
</BulletIcon>
<Br />
Thats How The Hash Indexes works But There are some limitations of the Hash Indexes
<BulletIcon>
  The table should fit in key so if you have very large number of entries than
  you are out of luck
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>Range Quries are not Efficient</BulletIcon>
<Br />
<Br />
<H1>SS Table</H1>
SS Table(Sorted String Table) are an immutable data structure commanly used in database
system, especially in NoSQLdatabase like LevelDB. They provide efficient storage
and retrival of sorted key-value pair.
<Br />
<H2>How Does SSTable Work in Database</H2>
<BulletIcon>
  Writes: Data is first written to Memtable. Once it reaches a threshold its
  flushed to disk as a new SSTable
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  Reads: A LookUp is performed in the MemTable first if not found in the
  MemTable. The system searched accross Multiple SSTable using Bloom Filter
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  Compaction: Over time, multiple SSTables accumulate. A compaction process
  merges and deletes obsolete data to improve efficiency.
</BulletIcon>
<H2>Limitation of SSTable</H2>
<BulletIcon>
  Since SS Table are immutable, new writes cannot modify existing SSTable
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  Over time, multiple SSTables accumulate because of the append-only nature.
  This leads to lookup performance degradation as there are too many SSTable
</BulletIcon>
<Br />
<Br />
<H1>B Tree</H1>
A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree used primary database and file systems to handle
large amount of data efficiently. Like SSTable B-tree keeps key-value pair in sorted
order by key. which allows efficient key-value lookups and range quries. But thats
where the similarities end: B-tree has very different design philosophy. Every B-tree
is made of node and child pointers. We call the top most node the root node, the
nodes on the bottom level leaf node and everything else interrnal nodes. The formal
defination of a B-tree can vary depending on who you ask. Heres the Defination of
B-tree
<Br />
<H2>A B-tree of order K is a tree with these properties:</H2>
<BulletIcon>Each node stores N key/value pairs, where 1 ≤ N ≤ K.</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  Internal nodes (except the root) have at least N/2 key/value pairs.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>Each node has N+1 children.</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  The root has at least one key and two children, unless it is the only node.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  All leaves are at the same level, keeping the tree balanced.
</BulletIcon>
<Br />
The other key characteristic of the B-tree is ordering. Within each node the
element are kept in order. Any child to the left of the key must only contain
other key that are less than it. Children to the right that are greater than it.
This enforced ordering means you can search key very efficiently. Starting at
the root node. do the following:
<BulletIcon>
  Check if the node contain the key that you are looking for.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  If you dont find the key than find the location where the key would be
  inserted into, if ypu are adding it.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  Follow the child pointer at this spot down to the next level, and repeat the
  process
</BulletIcon>

  Advantages of Btree: Btree are widely used in database and file system due to
  their unique advantages:
</H2>
<BulletIcon>
  The Balanced nature of B-tree ensures the operation like search, insertion and
  deletion have a consistent performance typically in logarithmic time (O(log
  n))
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  B-tree are designed to minimize the disk I/O operations this make them ideal
  for the application that require frequent data retrival from disk storage.
</BulletIcon>
<Br />
<H2>Application of B-tree:</H2>
B-tree are used in various application where quick and efficient data retrival
are required. Here are some applications of B-tree
<BulletIcon>
  Database is the most common usecase for the Btree as most of the modern
  database use B-tree for indexing as this structure allows quick lookups,
  insertion, deletion and range quries.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  File System also uses the B-tree to manage directory and file entries
  efficiently. Apple Filesystem uses B-tree varient for managing metadata.
</BulletIcon>
<BulletIcon>
  In operating system B-tree are used to manage virtual memory and address
  translation.
</BulletIcon>
<Br />

<H1>Conclusion</H1>
B-trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, particularly in systems
where efficient data storage and retrieval are critical. Their balanced nature, efficient
disk access, and scalability make them ideal for applications ranging from databases
to file systems
